-- Migration 013: Fix RLS Policies for Tenants Table with Emergency Contact Fields
-- This migration updates RLS policies to ensure emergency contact fields are accessible

-- First, let's check if RLS is enabled and what policies exist
DO $$
BEGIN
  RAISE NOTICE 'Checking current RLS status for tenants table...';
END $$;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist to recreate them properly
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Landlords can view their tenants" ON tenants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Landlords can insert their tenants" ON tenants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Landlords can update their tenants" ON tenants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Landlords can delete their tenants" ON tenants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON tenants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert access for authenticated users" ON tenants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update access for authenticated users" ON tenants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete access for authenticated users" ON tenants;

-- Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE tenants ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create comprehensive policies that work with emergency contact fields
-- Policy 1: Allow landlords to view tenants in their properties
CREATE POLICY "Landlords can view their tenants" ON tenants
FOR SELECT USING (
  -- Allow if tenant is in a unit owned by the landlord
  current_unit_id IN (
    SELECT units.id FROM units

-- Policy 2: Allow landlords to insert tenants (simplified for now)

-- Policy 4: Allow landlords to delete their tenants

-- CREATE POLICY "Enable insert access for authenticated users" ON tenants
-- FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL OR auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- CREATE POLICY "Enable update access for authenticated users" ON tenants
-- FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL OR auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- CREATE POLICY "Enable delete access for authenticated users" ON tenants
-- FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL OR auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role');

-- Grant necessary permissions to authenticated users
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON tenants TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON tenants TO service_role;

-- Ensure the sequence is accessible
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE tenants_id_seq TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE tenants_id_seq TO service_role;
