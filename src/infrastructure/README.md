# Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer contains implementations of external concerns like databases, external APIs, file systems, and third-party services.

## Structure

```
infrastructure/
├── repositories/      # Repository implementations
├── external-services/ # Third-party service integrations
├── persistence/       # Database configurations and migrations
├── messaging/         # Event bus and messaging implementations
├── caching/          # Caching implementations
├── logging/          # Logging implementations
├── security/         # Security implementations
└── config/           # Configuration management
```

## Principles

1. **Implementation Details**: Contains all external dependencies
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Adapts external services to domain interfaces
3. **Configuration**: Manages all external configurations
4. **Persistence**: Handles data storage and retrieval
5. **Integration**: Integrates with external systems

## Guidelines

- Repository implementations should map between domain entities and database models
- External service adapters should handle API communication and error handling
- Configuration should be centralized and environment-aware
- Caching should be transparent to the application layer
- Logging should provide comprehensive audit trails
